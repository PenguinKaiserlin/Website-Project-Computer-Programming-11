            <h3>Travelling in Europe</h3>
            <p>It’s no secret Europe is an appealing continent for country-hopping. Once you’re there, cycle-friendly streets, extensive train systems, and relatively cheap inter-country flights make it highly accessible.</p>
            <p>Scenery wise, Europe has everything from snowy mountains, lush forests, and glittering beaches to ultra-modern cities, medieval villages, and Neolithic structures. Wherever you go, you can just as easily spend your time immersed in local history, art, and architecture as you can lingering over a four-hour meal, wandering cobblestone streets, or dancing the night (or day) away.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge in planning a trip to Europe is deciding where to go. To make it a little easier, here is a collection of the top countries to travel to. These four countries feature a wide range of activites, experiences, and lacndscapes that distinguish themselves from the rest.  and they feature a wide range of activities, experiences, and landscapes, so whichever you choose, you'll find something for every type of traveler.</p>
